EXECUTABLE NAME: raytracer
USAGE: ./raytracer [cameraFile] [materialFile] [model1 ... modeln] [outputFile]

NOTE: my program is VERY slow, so give it a WHILE on larger inputs
NOTE: for a ballpark estimate on itâ€™s speed:
	it ran sphere in about 10 minutes
	it ran 2 mirrors and a dodecahedron in 10seconds
	it ran a window and a dodecahedron in 10seconds
	it ran a clear cube, a sphere, and a pyramid, in 2 hours
